  - ✅ Ensured all required packages are listed:
    - ✅ `temporalio` for Temporal Python SDK
    - ✅ `fastapi` and `uvicorn` for API
    - ✅ `sqlmodel` and `asyncpg` for database operations
    - ✅ `httpx` for HTTP clients
    - ✅ `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio` for testing
  - ✅ Configured development dependencies
- **Definition of Done:** Complete dependency specification for the project

### 5. ✅ Database Setup
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Create database connection and models
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Steps:**
  - ✅ Implemented database connection handling in `backend/db/connection.py`
  - ✅ Set up SQLModel engine with async support
  - ✅ Created base model class with common fields
  - ✅ Migration strategy (Alembic) configured with initial migration
- **Definition of Done:** Database connection and ORM ready for model definitions

### 6. ✅ Temporal Client Integration
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Set up Temporal client configuration
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Steps:**
  - ✅ Created `backend/temporal/client.py` for Temporal client configuration
  - ✅ Implemented connection function with error handling
  - ✅ Configured namespace settings
  - ✅ Created utility functions for workflow operations
- **Definition of Done:** Reusable Temporal client configuration

### 7. ✅ Dummy Workflow Implementation (Optional)
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Create a simple dummy workflow for testing Temporal integration
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Note:** Full health check workflow is NOT required for this milestone
- **Steps:**
  - ✅ Created `backend/workflows/dummy_workflow.py`:
    - ✅ Implemented a basic `DummyWorkflow` class with minimal functionality
    - ✅ Included proper documentation following project standards
  - ✅ Created `backend/activities/dummy_activity.py`:
    - ✅ Implemented a simple activity function
    - ✅ Added basic status check functionality
  - ✅ Followed deterministic workflow design principles
- **Definition of Done:** Simple workflow that demonstrates basic Temporal integration

### 8. ✅ Worker Implementation
- **Priority:** High
- **Description:** Implement worker service for workflow and activity execution
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Steps:**
  - ✅ Created `backend/workers/worker.py` with worker configuration
  - ✅ Registered workflows and activities with worker
  - ✅ Configured task queues
  - ✅ Implemented graceful shutdown handling
  - ✅ Added logging configuration
- **Definition of Done:** Worker service ready to process Temporal tasks

### 9. ✅ API Integration
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Create health check API endpoint
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Steps:**
  - ✅ Added health check endpoint to `backend/api/main.py`
  - ✅ Implemented Temporal client integration
  - ✅ Created synchronous and asynchronous workflow trigger endpoints
  - ✅ Added proper error handling and status codes
- **Definition of Done:** API endpoints that demonstrate Temporal workflow execution

### 10. ✅ Documentation
- **Priority:** Low
- **Description:** Create comprehensive documentation
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Steps:**
  - ✅ Updated project README.md with setup instructions
  - ✅ Added inline code documentation
  - ✅ Documented environment variables and configuration
- **Definition of Done:** Clear documentation for developers to understand and run the project

### 11. ✅ Testing
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Description:** Implement tests for health check workflow
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Steps:**
  - ✅ Created unit tests for activities
  - ✅ Implemented integration tests for workflows with mock activities
  - ✅ Added API tests for endpoints
  - ⚠️ GitHub Actions for CI will be configured in a future update
- **Definition of Done:** Test suite validating the implementation

## Deliverable Validation
To validate the milestone completion, the following should be demonstrable:
1. Developer can clone the repository and start development environment with minimal effort
2. (Optional) Simple dummy workflow can be executed and monitored in Temporal UI
3. All tests pass successfully
4. Documentation provides clear instructions for using the system

## Technical Considerations
- **Determinism in Workflows:** Ensure workflow code is deterministic as per Temporal requirements
- **Idempotency:** Design activities to be idempotent to support Temporal's retry mechanisms
- **Task Queue Design:** Set up appropriate task queues for different types of work
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling at both workflow and activity levels

## Next Steps
Upon completion of Milestone 1, the team will be ready to proceed to Milestone 2 (Article Intake Workflow), building on the established foundation.
